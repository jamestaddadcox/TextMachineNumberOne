        <p>Once, when you were nearly an adult, you heard her voice. What may have been her voice. Late at night, a womanâ€™s voice on the landline (there was still a landline then), asking, brusquely, businesslike, for your father. You told her he was not available. A beat as she understood who you were. Something like a break in her voice (though you may have imagined it) when she said goodbye.</p>
