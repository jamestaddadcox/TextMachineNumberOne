            <p>You have tried to find this house again. You have walked down the street you are sure is the street where you once lived, found the location that corresponds to the location of the house in your memory. There is no house there, there is no indication that a house ever was there. Where the house should be: a nonspace, an insufficient nothingness between one house and the next. Although perhaps it was someplace else, a different address, a different street.
